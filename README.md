This website serves as a capstone project for the scrimba course "Advance React". It helps me understand how useful context and hooks are. It showed how to be proficient and dry with your code and be a better programmer after all. This serves as a big lesson for me and other students as it tackles all of the advance react concepts and made me understand all of it.
